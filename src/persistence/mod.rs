/// From "Paxos Made Simple":
///     Agents operate at arbitrary speed, may fail by stopping, and may restart.
///     Since all agents may fail after a value is chosen and then restart,
///     a solution is impossible unless some information can be re-membered
///     by an agent that has failed and restarted.
